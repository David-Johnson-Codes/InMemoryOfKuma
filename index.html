            <p class="aboutKuma aboutKumaTop">My wife and I brought Kuma home in the summer of 2018. He was the second
                ferret of the
                house and had a loveable personality. Kuma always gave kisses, potty trained himself, enjoyed attention,
                and was considered one of the titans due to his size. As a kit, we joked how he looked like a body
                builder
                while running around. When fully grown, Kuma was double the size of our largest female ferret. <br><br>

            </p>
            <p class="aboutKuma">
                The first word that comes to my mind when describing Kuma would be, "kind". With the other ferrets, he
                always gently played with them despite his size, thus we called him, "King Ferret". Every day he would
                come up to
                my leg wanting to be picked up.
                He was also one of the few ferrets that would clean us by licking and gave some nibbles.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="aboutKuma">
                Kuma
                passed away early in the year of 2022. He will always be missed and never forgotten.
