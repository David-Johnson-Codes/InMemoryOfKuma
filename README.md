# InMemoryOfKuma
Simple webpage of Kuma's Memorial

This webpage was created with only HTML and CSS. 

The main design aspect was using flex box to create a image collage for desktop view. On smaller view ports, a single image is used to avoid cluttering the simple design.

Notes - May consider expanding this project to include other ferrets we have lost. This can be done by adding nav bar with other pages each dedicated to a specific ferret.
